Da'vali Update (29-04-2022)
-------------------------------------------------

This update contains the following changes. 

Unity:

-Replaced all Dynamic bones with Physbones and set them up.
-Removed unused parameters.
-Added snootboop and headpat detectors that respond to fingers and hands.
-Puppet menus (Ears and Tail) are now fully funtional. 
-Added a Blelele toggle.
-Unity project has been rebuilt to avoid clashing with other avatars created by Rai Kitamatsu.
-Added a prebuilt animation for gestures for every preset expression.
-Hand, Finger, Foot, Torso and Head colliders have been adjusted to fit the Da'vali.

Wings have dynamics but are not grabbable and do not collide. This is due to wing bone placement.
Attempts to make the wings grabbable without moving the position of the wing bone away from the hand in blender interferes with your own hands ability to grab other Physbones as the wings bones will be in the way.

Blender: 

-All shapekeys have been updated/improved. 
-More shapekeys have been added.
-Unused hair bone removed.
-Hair parent bone added.
-Toe bones added. (Unrigged).
-Ear parent bone centered.

The FX animator is already set up to work with the expressions menu, Blinking(That pauses when you do any gesture that is not hand open or fist) and Gestures(Facial expressions that trigger on hand gestures). 

These can be found in Assets->DavaliAssets->Animations->Controllers

FX is for the Facial animation, Blinking and expression menu animations.

3.0 functions:

Simple expressions menu has been set up. I will update it again with a more optimized menu that uses less params in the future. Clothing toggles will also be added for when the Da'vali clothing releases.



If you find any bugs let me know at Rai Kitamatsu#5172 or in model-help in the Avali Army server.
